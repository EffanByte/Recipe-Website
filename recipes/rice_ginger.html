    <h1> Rice with Chicken Ginger</h1>
    <img src = "https://www.jocooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ginger-chicken-1-3-1-730x913.jpg" alt = "Picture of White rice with gravy chicken on top" style = "width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<p> This savory dish is made by cooking the white rice separately from the chicken ginger
    , which is very different from the traditional method of cooking them all in the same pot.
    The chicken gravy is cooked separately and then added to white rice once they're boiled. 
    The plainness of the rice makes it very appealing to eat with the strong and tomato-ish taste of the chicken ginger.
