# Recipe-Website
Creating my first Website Using the Odin's Project. This website relies entirely on HTML.

I'll be using simple html tags to create a relatively okay website. I've learned enough to know how HTML generally works. I will try to make this as good as it can be using only HTML. Maybe add a couple of images, resize them, etc. Do whatever I can.
